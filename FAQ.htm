<h1>FAQ</h1>


<h2>Where's the documentation?</h2>
<p>There isn't much documentation at the moment. But now that LCD Smartie is open-source we hope for that to change. <a href="docs.html">Here's the beginnings of some documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Which displays are supported?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All serial/usb Crystalfontz displays.</li>
	<li>All serial/usb Matrix Orbital displays.</li>
	<li>All parallel connected LCD's with a HD44780 compatible controller and with 8bit wiring (<a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">using this wiring</a>).</li>
	<li>Serial/usb displays with an HD44780 controller, such as Pertelian displays.</li>
	<li>Most serial/usb/BT/IR PalmOS devices (when used with <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a>) [USB support is experimental]</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently supported sizes (can add more if required):
<ul>
	<li>1x10, 1x16, 1x20, 1x24, 1x40,</li>
	<li>2x16, 2x16, 2x20, 2x24, 2x40,</li>
	<li>4x16, 4x20, 4x40</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>My display isn't supported!</h2>
<p>You may want to create a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&amp;group_id=122330&amp;atid=693139">Feature Request</a> for your display - if one doesn't already exist, but new hardware requests will be treated as low priority (very low if I don't have the hardware).</p>
<p>But there is still hope, if you're technically minded and your display is serial (or has a virtual serial port) and it is command based (i.e you send a simple series of bytes to goto the beginning of line 1 and send 'A' to display 'A', rather than directly controlling the pins of a display). Check out the '<a href="testdriver.html">Test Driver</a>'.

<h2>How do I get LCD Smartie working with my PalmOS PDA?</h2>
<p>Install <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a> on your palm, and configure smartie as if it was a Matrix Orbital 4x20 display.</p>
<p>For further instructions/details/support visit the PalmOrb site.</p>

<h2>Under what OS does it work?</h2>
<p>Under Win95/Win98/WinME/WinNT/Win2k/WinXP. [Smartie version &lt; 5.3]</p>
<p><strong>Smartie 5.3 and above only supports Win2k, WinXP, and newer versions of Window.</strong></p>


<h2>Why doesn't my HD44780 controlled LCD work?</h2>
<p>A short guide:
<ul>
	<li>Smartie currently only support <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">8bit wiring</a>.</li>
	<li>First off all: check, check and recheck your <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">wirings</a>!</li>
	<li>if you get ANYTHING on your LCD, your wiring is likely to be (almost) correct.</li>
	<li>Second: Try setting the "timing multiplier" (in HD44780 options) to 5 and restarting.</li>
	<li>Third: check your bios, and turn your LTP port settings to EPP (sometimes ECP does work, but EPP is better)</li>
	<li>still not good? then you should take a good look at your LCD. The controller, and if it it REALY compatible with a HD44780 (the standard)</li>
	<li>If than your LCD don't work, it's proberbly broken or you didn't make the correct wiring</li>
</ul>

<h2>In what language is it written?</h2>
<p>In Delphi 7</p>
<p>Plugins can be written in any language that allows you to build a DLL. Current Plugins are written in Delphi and C++.</p>

<h2>Why is my CPU Usage always at 0?</h2>
<p>LCD Smartie uses the CPU Usage Performance counters to get the current CPU load. These are disabled on some machines - please check the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfOS\Performance" to check for existence of
"Disable Performance Counters" Key. If this is set to 1 then try changing it
to 0 and rebooting.</p>

<h2>I'm getting the error &quot;dlportio.sys driver was not loaded. Port I/O will have no effect&quot;</h2>
<p>Install <a href="port95nt.exe">port95nt</a> if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Otherwise, run regedit and visit &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dlportio&quot;. Change the Start value to &quot;1&quot; and reboot.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then run regedit and visit &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services&quot;. Delete the key &quot;dlportio&quot;, reboot and reinstall port95nt.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong> The use of regedit is at your own risk.</p>
