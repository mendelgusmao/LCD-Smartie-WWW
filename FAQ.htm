<h1>FAQ</h1>


<h2>Where's the documentation?</h2>
<p>There isn't much documentation at the moment. But now that LCD Smartie is open-source we hope for that to change. <a href="docs.html">Here's the beginnings of some documentation</a>.

<h2>Which LCD's are supported?</h2>
<p>Almost all LCD's with a 44780 controller, a Matrix Orbital controller, a Crystalfontz one, or a PalmOS device (when used with <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a>):<br />
1x10, 1x16, 1x20, 1x24, 1x40, <br />
2x16, 2x16, 2x20, 2x24, 2x40, <br />
4x16, 4x20, 4x40</p>
<p>Currently for HD44780 devices, only 8bit wiring is supported.</p>

<h2>How do I get LCD Smartie working with my PalmOS PDA?</h2>
<p>Install <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a> on your palm, and configure smartie as if it was a Matrix Orbital 4x20 display.</p>
<p>For further instructions/details visit the PalmOrb site.</p>

<h2>Under what OS does it work?</h2>
<p>Under Win95/Win98/WinME/WinNT/Win2k/WinXP.</p>

<h2>And what can LCD Smartie do?</h2>
<p>There is a full list of features <a href="list.htm" target="_new">right here.</a></p>

<h2>Why doesn't my HD44780 controlled LCD work?</h2>
<p>A short guide:
<ul>
	<li>Smartie currently only support <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">8bit wiring</a>.</li>
	<li>First off all: check, check and recheck your <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">wirings</a>!</li>
	<li>if you get ANYTHING on your LCD, your wiring is likely to be (almost) correct.</li>
	<li>Second: check your bios, and turn your LTP port settings to EPP (sometimes ECP does work, but EPP is better)</li>
	<li>still not good? then you should take a good look at your LCD. The controller, and if it it REALY compatible with a HD44780 (the standard)</li>
	<li>If than your LCD don't work, it's proberbly broken or you didn't make the correct wiring</li>
</ul>

<h2>In what language is it written?</h2>
<p>In Delphi 7</p>

<h2>Why is my CPU Usage always at 0?</h2>
<p>LCD Smartie uses the CPU Usage Performance counters to get the current CPU load. These are disabled on some machines - please check the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfOS\Performance" to check for existence of 
"Disable Performance Counters" Key. If this is set to 1 then try changing it
to 0 and rebooting.</p>
