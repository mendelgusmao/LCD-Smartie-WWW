<h1>FAQ</h1>


<h2>Where's the documentation?</h2>
<p>There isn't much documentation at the moment. But now that LCD Smartie is open-source we hope for that to change. <a href="docs.html">Here's the beginnings of some documentation</a>.

<h2>Which LCD's are supported?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All serial/usb Crystalfontz displays.</li>
	<li>All serial/usb Matrix Orbital displays.</li>
	<li>All parallel connected LCD's with a HD44780 compatible controller and with 8bit wiring (<a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">using this wiring</a>).</li>
	<li>Most serial/usb/BT/IR PalmOS devices (when used with <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently supported sizes (can add more if required):
<ul>
	<li>1x10, 1x16, 1x20, 1x24, 1x40,</li> 
	<li>2x16, 2x16, 2x20, 2x24, 2x40,</li>
	<li>4x16, 4x20, 4x40</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>How do I get LCD Smartie working with my PalmOS PDA?</h2>
<p>Install <a href="http://palmorb.sourceforge.net">PalmOrb</a> on your palm, and configure smartie as if it was a Matrix Orbital 4x20 display.</p>
<p>For further instructions/details visit the PalmOrb site.</p>
<p><strong>NB: </strong>USB Palm support relies on Palm's undocumented USB driver - this has been known to cause the palm to reset, and even for Windows to crash (Blue Screen). If you experience this, then try upgrading your palm desktop to the latest version from Palm.  <a href="http://kb.palmone.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/WEBCGI.EXE/,/?St=648,E=0000000000107626537,K=3215,Sxi=17,useTemplate=Case.tem,CASE=26344">This Palm support article</a> may also be useful.</p>

<h2>Under what OS does it work?</h2>
<p>Under Win95/Win98/WinME/WinNT/Win2k/WinXP.</p>

<h2>And what can LCD Smartie do?</h2>
<p>There is a full list of features <a href="list.htm" target="_new">right here.</a></p>

<h2>Why doesn't my HD44780 controlled LCD work?</h2>
<p>A short guide:
<ul>
	<li>Smartie currently only support <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">8bit wiring</a>.</li>
	<li>First off all: check, check and recheck your <a href="http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/circuits.htm">wirings</a>!</li>
	<li>if you get ANYTHING on your LCD, your wiring is likely to be (almost) correct.</li>
	<li>Second: Try setting the "timing multiplier" (in HD44780 options) to 5 and restarting.</li>
	<li>Third: check your bios, and turn your LTP port settings to EPP (sometimes ECP does work, but EPP is better)</li>
	<li>still not good? then you should take a good look at your LCD. The controller, and if it it REALY compatible with a HD44780 (the standard)</li>
	<li>If than your LCD don't work, it's proberbly broken or you didn't make the correct wiring</li>
</ul>

<h2>In what language is it written?</h2>
<p>In Delphi 7</p>
<p>Plugins can be written in any language that allows you to build a DLL. Current Plugins are written in Delphi and C++.</p>

<h2>Why is my CPU Usage always at 0?</h2>
<p>LCD Smartie uses the CPU Usage Performance counters to get the current CPU load. These are disabled on some machines - please check the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfOS\Performance" to check for existence of 
"Disable Performance Counters" Key. If this is set to 1 then try changing it
to 0 and rebooting.</p>
