Great program, but I would like support for winamp 3 :-)<br><br>one more thing; at http://members.lycos.nl/basiep/suggest.php you said that smartie would be open source in the future. Any idea when?
13-08-02 11:01
BasieP
i am not adding winamp 3 support yet for 2 reasons:<br>1: winamp 3 takes for 1 single mp3 file about 11 MB of your RAM, and uses about 26% of a 800Mhz system and 21% of a 1400Mhz system.. (so don't use it)<br>2: they don't made a complete API for it, which means IF i should make support i have to change that everytime they change somehting<br>

I have heard alot of people complain that LCD Smartie has alot of memory leaks, well I was recently on the motherboard monitor site (http://mbm.livewiredev.com/) and they have addressed a memory leak problem with their 5.2.x version, the newest version corrects that. Check it out, hopefully it will correct some problems. The actual link to the update is: http://mbm.livewiredev.com/download/MBMUPDATE.zip<br><br>Check it out!

As far as I understand, there are a couple of inputlines available on the parallel port (i.e. "paper out" and "busy") which could be used as input buttons for LCDSmartie. Is it possible to include support for these in the next release?

Dear Author!<br>Had you ever seen what happenes on the screen when non-Latin letter are used at the winamp tags?:).I got lots of Russian mp3s, and all tags looks nice inside emulated LCD, but on the real one... just set of unreadable signs.

hey i got a suggestion and a bit of advise...the suggestion is that i would like to see some transitions for the screens...i would like to be able to have a matrix effect where letters drop in something like that and etc. i would also like hot buttons to be able to change the screen to the next one, and freeze the current screen from anywhere in windows....i like to see different system stats while i'm in games and i can't exet out everytime to change the screen or freee it...crystalcontrol has this implemented...can u implement this aswell? also i found a way to get WMP9 song stats on my lcd through ur program...i used a plugin for wmp9 called nowplaying...originally designed for coolmon, but it creates a simple text document with the song stats on it. so i use this command $File("C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\playinfo.txt",1) to access it and it works perfectly =)

I'm running Win98SE, the none of the Internet things work, the temperatures don't work with MBM 5.1 or 5.2, and I get a BSOD when LCDSmartie tries to access the Winamp screen while Winamp is not running or if I shutdown Winamp while on the Winamp screen.
09-02-03 21:11

And also, you could incorporate the Crystalfontz built-in per-pixel scrolling for Crystalfontz serial displays, looks better and doesn't take up bandwidth like your software scrolling. :)  I know I'm making a lot of criticisms here, but your LCDSmartie is still great, and is now my permenent LCD software. :D

Really sweet program !<br>Would it be possible to make some kind of animation.. f.ex. when you start a game, let's say CS, you get a anime of a bullet flying from one end of the lcd too the other.<br>Maybe it could be made, by letting the program execute a movie-file in the restricted pixel, f.ex. 4x20... So maybe its more a plugin, where you can make the movie-file and then use smartie too execute it?<br>Just an idea.

First of all, great job! Wishlist: numbers should be possible to be displayed in fixed digits, like "007" instead of "7" or "3.900" instead of "3.6"; then date format like 05/07/03, not only 05/07/2003, maybe even just 05/07; time format without seconds (all these should be fairly easy to implement); finally, a hdd usage meter (measuring how "hard" the hard drive is working) would be nice! Last, stopped winamp playtime should be "0:00" and not "0".<br><br>Live long and prosper...<br>

First I got to say this is an excellent program. It turns out I bought many odd sized lcds for my computers. Is it possible to add support for 2X32 lcds or is there a current workaround. right now I just have to be careful of how I do the layout. That the only thing I can think of right now. Thanks for all the work you've done. It's appreciated.

Hi, It would be nice to have a option to run the HD44780 in 4 bit mode instead of just the 8 bit. A lot of displays only have the 4 bit option.<br>If i got it correct its just to send 2 4 bit words instead of one 8 bit.

First of all, bravo for the good work!A couple of suggestions: <br>First of all, and I think that others will agree, it would be very useful if the program had the option of automatically loading at Windows Startup (in minimised form on the system tray at the right of the taskbar).<br>Second, since Windows Media Player is the most commonly used media software it would be nice if it displayed its contents as in Winamp. Customisation of actions with other software would also be very useful, but of course I understand that all of the above have to be done one step at a time!<br>Anyway, the success of what you've got is based on the fact that it's easy to use and pretty reliable. Any suggestions should be taken as a compliment of your work because it means people are enjoying your creation!:)

This isn't really a suggestion and I couldn't find it anywhere else on your site. I can't get your program to run. It says that there are images missing and I have downloaded the lastest 5.1 2nd bugfix. Are there directories I need to place certain files to get it to work? Thanks

For all of you who wish to have LCD Smartie start in the minimized mode I have a suggestion. if you make a shortcut to the .exe file and then go to the properties of that shortcut and under the shortcut tab of the properties menu click on the pull down box for "Run:" and change it to minimize. Then just put that shortcut in your statup folder THIS WILL START IT IN MINIMIZED MODE!!!

22-03-03 22:09

Doesnt work with WA3 for me<br><br>Ashsama - you change them yourself in the config. if its parallel then you broke it, if its serial, make sure the unit is set to its absolute max, then adjust smartie accordingly.

Will there be support for more lcd's in the future?? Such like the Graphical LCD with a t6963c???

Instead of specific support for CNN and weather.com I think that LCD Smartie should have support for RSS feeds. That way it would support all news sites which expose their headlines as RSS feeds.

I have a celeron 500 server box, running Win2000 server with NAT routing enabled on a demand dial, but for some reason, the Networks stats dont work. Any ideas? Network stats work for me with the moo.dll plugin for mIRC, could you support this dll in LCDsmartie?<br>-I am running a 2x24 LCD<br>Thanks for the great program.

Is it possible to ad support for for example Mediaplayer, so we can from the display see what movie whe are wathing and the time? Have you been thinking about the ICQ support? And I'd love to have for Winamp the opportunity to have "Artist" and "Songname" as separate, most users have them in standard form "Artist - Songname" so it shouldn't be so difficult. Then it would be nice to know next song in playlist... Keep up the good work, we're all waiting for a new version of this great software! =)

I'm using your last 5.2 with Win XP, and I noticed a bug when I forget entering a "time" value in the interaction menu. It always happen when there were no interaction style selected before for a given screen. A warning message appears, and then you cannot modify anything, you can't close smartie. And when you launch it the next time, program don't run, and error messages are all around the win screen..

That's great help for me no need to write a program to control it.<br><br>But there's some problems...<br>First, the $CustomChar function can't excetly make one char. the last line of the char become 'carzy'. and the arrangement are not in order(the chr(1) become the five char in the memory...). there's some problem with this function.<br>And the other problem is that when i put the download speed value into the $bar func. it display 'error'. May be it can't support floating point? Still can't find a solution. Also, the value of the network speed doesn't display correctly. And then after certain time it will display correct-.-|||<br>And the... Just a little bit suggestion... Can you make it support Japanese? Because HT44700 can display Japanese Characters...<br>Please Fix them! Thanks!

Is it possible to support HD44780 devices which connect using an LCD serial backpack? I'm a novice at this, but it seems that this is basically a device which allows the parallel-port based HD44780 to be driven via the serial port. I have one of these; it hooks up to the serial port although the display is an HD44780 one. I use the driver from here: http://lcdriver.pointofnoreturn.org/<br><br>There is information about the serial backpack here: http://www.seetron.com/bpk_faq.htm<br><br>Many thanks.

First: I want to say I LOVE LCD Smartie. It's amazing.<br><br>Here's my suggestion:<br>In the setup have it be able to read from a txt file like $txtline1, $txtline2, $txtline3 ...<br>That way you can put in whatever text you want.<br><br>Specifically, I want to write a php script so that users on my website can enter a phrase, it'll be put into the txt file and then it'll show up on the lcd.<br><br>Also, if you add txt file support, people can write their own programs to get their own statistics or whatever and have their own program dump info into the txt file - then LCD smartie can read from it. It opens a whole new world of possibilities for ammateur programmers like myself.<br><br>BTW,<br>My LCD Project will soon be on my site with my other projects. I'd be interested to know what you think, Basie.<br><br>Thanks! Please consider it.<br><br>Jon Bennett<br>www.JBProjects.net

Math Functions. The $Count Function is a nice addition. But, I would like to do other math with values (add, subtract, multiply, divide).<br><br>Main reason. I would like the Temps from MBM to be displayed in Fahrenheit (Not Celsius like MBM does). The Math would be ($Temp1,*9,/5,+32).

You have a useful wiring diagram allowing to turn the VFD on and off programmatically. <br><br>Would it be possible to have a wiring diagram where the VFD brightness could be controlled programmatically from Smartie? Even having 2 levels ("normal" and "dim") would be great; 3 or 4 levels would be ideal. I would imagine some simple circuit might be required as part of the wiring. That would be OK. Thanks!!

Quote from wishlist:<br>Winamp Spectrum analizer - Can't be done see: http://www.winamp.com/nsdn <br><br>This feature can be done using a vis plug in. Rather than rendering to screen, send the spectrum infomation to LCD Smartie.

Expand the screen skip/don't skip function to include process detection so when say, ZoomPlayer is running, it will stay on a screen that displays the zoomplayer information and when you shut it off, smartie will starting running through different screens. That way, smartie could be set to run application specific automatically, without having to enable/disable screen manually. Thanks for this great software, by the way!!

I would like to provide some feedback on the "is not a valid integer value" error reported by WindowsME users like me.<br><br>This error only exists if a shortcut was placed in the startup-folder by rightclicking the smartie.exe icon in the folder it is installed in, and consequently copying the thus created desktopshortcut in the startupfolder.<br><br>There is however a workaround to have smartie launched at startup in a proper way: Go to start -> settings -> taskbar and startmenu -> advanced tab -> advanced button and create a new shortcut manually in the startupfolder. It worked for me!<br><br>I would though like to report that the CNN headlines link doesn't work here. (stocks and tweakers do!)

The $bar doesn't work with decimal numbers. That's annoying because it would be nice to draw bars from network traffic. Like This:<br>$Bar($NetSpDownK(1),100,10)<br>But that doesn't work, because there is one decimal in NetSpDownK. And that causes an error.<br><br>Well, I found one situation when the bar & netsp combination works: When the network traffic is 0. :D<br><br>It would also be nice to be able to calculate things before showing them on the screen. Something like $Count, but with decimal numbers ($Count(1.1#1.2) causes an error..). Also multiplying and dividing would be nice!<br><br>But thanks for a good program, anyway! Haven't found better yet! :)

Is there a way to use Smartie with a usb-vfd? My vfd came with my HTPC case from Ahanix, and its connected to a usb-control board. I think it's the same controller as the Sasem Remocon.

I thank LCD smartie is the best one.<br>But if it can support that is better . <br>For example : windows media player , power DVD . <br>Add a shortcut key to cycle the LCD display's screen .

You might want to see how Coolbits runs without having to have MBM run as well. They have a way to start the .dll MBM uses to gather info. If I could figure out how, I would start the .dll so I dont have to have MBM run with lcd smartie. But, kudos to you man, lcd smartie is by far the best program I've found for my lcd

Saw this one up there but wanted to re-voice since this is one of the few I've seen that has QStat working right(I've been working on my own software and I'm about to give up on qstat and figure out the protocols on my own!) but I need something that works for the 8x24 vt100 serial LCD found at earthLCD - specificly the one used at www.pjrc.com in thier mp3 player. You can find these (NOW WITH THE SERIAL CONNECTER - I wish that was offered when I got mine) on ebay for about $19.99 by searching for "serial LCD"

I've come across an excellent plugin for WMP9 that writes the current track to a text file enabling this to be displayed on my VFD. However there I have no way of getting LCDsmartie to establish whether this app is active or not. Any chance a dialog could be added to allow any .exe to be added to the active/not active pull down list?<br><br>thanks in advance

How about some instructions? Unless your an UBER-GEEK, this aint so straight forward, dealing with the reqired program for the ports and this one for the LCD, and no incling on what to do with each. It took over 5 hours to get a dispay that LOOKED right, but still the data is not correct. example: CPU USAGE =0%?? Not when MS XP tells me it's 24% while I record TV, surf the web, and compile a CD!

I have tried all the others LCD programs and this one is the best by far.<br>Here I have some sugestions for the wish list.<br>1-Interaction, from middle to the corners.<br>2-Interaction, from the corners to the middle.<br>3-Intercation, droping the characters.<br>4-Space on Drive (x)GB, whit some decimals. I have this case UsedSpace/TotalSpaceGB, and i see 9/19GB, i would like to see 9,5/18,6GB or 9,52/18,62GB.<br>5-Used, free, total, % and bar for video memory (VRAM).<br>6-Current aplication on use.<br>7-Number of aplications running.<br>8-And finaly is it posible to visualize informatión from the Windows Media player? The only thing i have done is to see the current track playing, but i would like to see remaining and total times<br><br>Also would be great to update the site, and display the sugest by pages!!!<br>Anyway thanks for the program and keep up the good work!<br>

Hi,<br>For a Home Theater PC (HTPC) a great tool is showshifter (http://www.showshifter.com)<br><br>It would be really cool if LCD Smartie could show current playing item (mainly album & track in MP3 mode, but also name of DIVX / photo etc.)<br><br>Oh Yeah.. and the BasieP comments above...

It would be great if there were a plugin to extract information from WinTV... If its dead and not going to be updated the least the source code should be released so people can work on their own updates and plugins
29-08-04 2:01
mike_klms
oh....and information from WMP like winamp
29-08-04 2:02
mike_klms
In the "Skip if is not running" feature it would be great if you could choose whatever program you wanted, by giving the file name. Also if there were something like "display only this screen if is running" so it would only only display certain screens if a certain program were running. Also another would be disk activity meter, such as a HDD or CD-ROM drive. Another is support for Nero, like when you are watching a DVD. Support for AIM, MSN, Yahoo, etc. to display screen name, time online, who you are talking to, away message, etc. Support to be able to take any piece of data out of System Information, although i dont know how useful that would be. Outlook support-listing current tasks or calender events. Fix the CPU usage thing! Support for Symantec, or Windows XPSP2 Security Center, to show anti-virus status, if updates are ready to be installed, if symantec is defraging and % of fragmentation, etc...i dont really know about that one. current headlines from google news. Display only email stuff if there is new email until you check it. Thats all i can think of right now...

Thanks first for making Smartie! I've used it with the Powertip PC1601F 1x16 lcd display with 14 pins. It works, but the first 8 characters are seen by Smartie as line 1; and the next 8 characters as line 2; I cannot use the full display roling. It would be nice if you programmed a 1x(2x8) mode.<br>Greetins, Marc<br>
